## Development

Use Node 24 (`nvm use`, pinned in `.nvmrc`). The Sanity CLI (`sanity schema deploy`,
`sanity typegen`, etc.) aborts with SIGABRT (exit 134) on teardown under Node 22 —
a `rolldown@1.1.5` native `napi_call_threadsafe_function` bug on darwin-arm64. The
command's work completes first, but the crash breaks exit codes. Node 24 exits cleanly.

When starting the dev server, use background mode:

```
astro dev --background
```

Manage the background server with `astro dev stop`, `astro dev status`, and `astro dev logs`.

## Sanity

Studio is embedded at `/studio`. Schema lives in `src/sanity/schemaTypes/` and is deployed
from that source via `sanity schema deploy` (Studio-managed — do not deploy via the MCP
`deploy_schema` tool, which would diverge). Content: `continent` -> `country` -> `post`,
with document-level PL/EN translations on `post`.
